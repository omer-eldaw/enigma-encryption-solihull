I decided to start my journal again in the hopes that I can reflect on my past days and see how much progress I have made. I have grown blind to the fact that I am growing and developing, always thinking in the back of my mind that I have not progressed, even though I have. To stop this from becoming a tick box like excercise, I will just start journalling whenever I feel like I want to.
